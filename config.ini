# General configuration parameters
# All these values can be altered during a session using commands
#
# rows_to_print=How many rows of the results to print. 0 means "print all".
#               Change it at runtime using :rows
#
# column_display_length=How many characters per column to print before
#                       truncating the value with "[...]". 0 means "print
#                       everything" Change it at runtime using :chars
#
# null_string=What to show when a value is NULL in the output. Change at
#             runtime using :null

# newline_replacement=Specify the character(s) to replace newlines. Empty means
#                     not to replace them. Change it at runtime using :newline
#
# tab_replacement=Specify the character(s) to replace tab chars. Empty means
#                 not to replace them. Change it at runtime using :tab
#
# command_timeout=Seconds for command timeouts - how long to wait for a command
#                 to finish running. This is set in the ODBC connection, use 0
#                 to "wait forever".

# Queries can use Python's format syntax for "replacement parameters", for
# example a query
# top10=SELECT TOP 10 FROM {table_name}
# will be invoked as
# >:top10
# And then prompt for a value for "table_name".
# This allows for commands that replace any text in the query, almost without
# limitations. Multiple parameters can be used.
# Any ? character can be used as a "query parameter" (ODBC standard). This is
# good to get values escaped. You can also combine both types of parameters:
# top_by_id=SELECT TOP {how_many} FROM {table} WHERE Name = ?
# will be invoked as
# >:top_by_id
# and then you will be prompted first for values for how_many and table. And
# once the query is formatted, there will be another prompt for a value for ?.
# It won't matter if the value for "Name" contains a single quote or any other
# special character, it gets escaped.
[queries]
# These are sample queries to showcase the parameter options
top=SELECT TOP {how_many} * FROM {table}
top-field=SELECT TOP {how_many} * FROM {table} WHERE {field} = ?
limit=SELECT * FROM {table} WHERE ItemId = ? LIMIT {how_many}   

# These are useful general commands, using INFORMATION_SCHEMA covers most DB
# engines. You can always customize them for other engines.
# Notice that we use a bit of trickery to specify a partial name in the parameter, or accept * as meaning "all"
# NOTE: don't forget to escape % with %% :)
